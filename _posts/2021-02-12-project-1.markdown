description: <blockquote> "You can always edit a bad page, but you canâ€™t edit a blank page" - Jodi Picoult</blockquote><h3>Knowledge Distillation [EN]</h3><p></br> The problem with current machine learning model is that they have large size. This model arise in high latency which make it not practical to deploy in edge devices, such as mobile phones. To overcome this problem, what if we build a small model and let the big model teach it? How is it possible? <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-bother-deploying-a-huge-neural-model-when-the-small-one-is-enough-47b9a2da8df1">[READ MORE]</a> </br> </br> </p> <h3>Web Crawling with BeautifulSoup [EN]</h3><p></br>Start learning web scraping with 5 lines of code in Python. <a href="https://idanovinda.medium.com/implementasi-web-scraping-dengan-menggunakan-beautifulsoup-python-edca4b9cdc47">[READ MORE]</a> </br></br></p> <h3>Introduction of Machine Learning [IND]</h3><p></br>Machine learning becomes so popular in every aspect of human life.
