                    <p>I am master student of computer science in <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html">Saarland University</a> (2018-now). 
                        I received my bachelor degree of computer science in <a href="https://www.ugm.ac.id/en">Universitas Gadjah Mada</a> (2014-2018). 
                        My bachelor thesis was doing classification on description questionâ€™s answer for Indonesian national exam using convolutional neural network and GloVe as the word embedding. 
                        The project was associated with the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture.</p>

                        <p>Before joining Saarland University, I have some industry experiences. I was working as a Data Engineer for 6 months in DALA Technology (2017-2018). 
                        During my work in DALA Technology, I was working on a project called Pusdatin (Integrated Data System). This project was associated with Indonesian Ministry of 
                        Energy and Mineral Resources and Pertamina. I was also employeed as a Data Analyst in <a href="http://kulina.id">Kulina</a> (2018). My works were mostly doing data analysis on customer data.
                        </p>

                        <p>Currently, I am working on my master's thesis which focus on exploration of knowledge distillation in masked language model.</p>

                        
                        <p>I am interested in data analysis and machine learning in natural language processing. I write articles in my medium
                         in English and Bahasa Indonesia. Check them out!</p>
