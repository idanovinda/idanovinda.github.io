I am master student of computer science in [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de) (2018-now). I received my bachelor degree of computer science in [Universitas Gadjah Mada](https://www.ugm.ac.id/) (2014-2018). My [bachelor thesis](http://etd.repository.ugm.ac.id/home/detail_pencarian/155545) was doing classification on description question's answer for Indonesian national exam using convolutional neural network and GloVe as the word embedding. The project was associated with the [Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture](https://www.kemdikbud.go.id).

Before joining Saarland University, I have some industry experiences. I was working as a Data Engineer for 6 months in [DALA Technology]() (2017-2018). During my work in [DALA Technology](), I was working on a project called Pusdatin (Integrated Data System). This project was associated with [Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources](https://www.esdm.go.id/) and [Pertamina](https://pertamina.com/). I was also employeed as a Data Scientist in [Kulina](https://www.kulina.id/) (2018). My works were mostly doing data analysis on customer data.  

I am interested to do research on natural language processing, machine learning, and information retrieval. I write articles about machine learning in my medium in Bahasa Indonesia. Check it out!
