I am master student of computer science in [Saarland University](uni-saarland.de) (2018-now). I received my bachelor degree of computer science in [Universitas Gadjah Mada](www.ugm.ac.id) (2014-2018). My [bachelor thesis](http://etd.repository.ugm.ac.id/home/detail_pencarian/155545) was doing classification on description question's answer for Indonesian national exam using convolutional neural network and GloVe as the embedding. 

Before joining Saarland University, I have some industry experiences. I was working as a Data Engineer for 6 months in [DALA Technology]() and as a Data Scientist in [Kulina](kulina.id) for 3 months.
